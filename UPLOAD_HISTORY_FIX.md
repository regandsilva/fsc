# Upload History Fix - Summary

## Problem
The upload history was not being recognized when reloading the web app because of a **type mismatch** issue:

- **In JSON file**: `batchNumber` was stored as a number (e.g., `6024`)
- **In TypeScript**: `batchNumber` is defined as a string type
- **Result**: When comparing `record.batchNumber === batchNumber`, JavaScript's strict equality (`===`) failed because one was a number and the other was a string

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed the Data Loading (localStorageService.ts)
Updated `loadUploadHistory()` to convert all `batchNumber` values to strings when loading from JSON:

```typescript
const normalizedItem: UploadedFileRecord = {
  ...item,
  batchNumber: String(item.batchNumber)
};
```

### 2. Fixed the Data Saving (localStorageService.ts)
Updated `uploadFile()` to ensure `batchNumber` is always stored as a string:

```typescript
const batchNumber = record['Batch number'] || 'NOBATCH';
const batchNumberStr = String(batchNumber); // Ensure it's always a string
```

### 3. Made Comparison Functions Type-Safe
Updated all methods that compare `batchNumber` to accept both string and number, then convert to string:

- `getUploadedFilesForBatch(batchNumber: string | number)`
- `getUploadedFileCount(batchNumber: string | number, docType: DocType)`
- `isFileUploaded(batchNumber: string | number, docType: DocType, fileName: string)`
- `getUploadedFile(batchNumber: string | number, docType: DocType, fileName: string)`
- `isFileInHistory(batchNumber: string | number, docType: DocType, fileName: string)`

Each method now does: `const batchStr = String(batchNumber);` before comparison.

### 4. Fixed Your Existing Upload History File
Ran a migration script that:
- ✅ Read all 87 records from `.upload-history.json`
- ✅ Created a backup (`.upload-history.json.backup`)
- ✅ Converted all numeric `batchNumber` values to strings
- ✅ Saved the fixed file

**Before:**
```json
{
  "batchNumber": 6024,
  "docType": "Purchase Order",
  ...
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "batchNumber": "6024",
  "docType": "Purchase Order",
  ...
}
```

## What This Fixes

✅ **Upload status icons** will now show correctly for previously uploaded files  
✅ **File counts** (e.g., "2/4" indicators) will be accurate  
✅ **Duplicate file detection** will work properly  
✅ **All existing uploads** (87 records) are now recognized  
✅ **Future uploads** will always save with the correct string type  

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Run the app: `npm run dev` or `npm run electron:dev`
2. Load your Airtable data
3. Check the upload status icons for batches 6024, 6025, 6113, 5863, etc.
4. The previously uploaded files should now show as completed (✓)

## Backup Location

A backup of your original upload history was created:
```
c:\Users\Regan.DaSilva\Wrapology International Ltd\Logistics - Documents\Logistics\FSC\.upload-history.json.backup
```

If anything goes wrong, you can restore from this backup.

## Files Modified

- `services/localStorageService.ts` - All fixes applied
- `c:\Users\Regan.DaSilva\Wrapology International Ltd\Logistics - Documents\Logistics\FSC\.upload-history.json` - Fixed data

## Files Created
