## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **Batch Completion Tracker with Visual Progress Bars**

#### What Was Added:
- **Progress bar column** in the data table showing completion status for each batch
- **Visual indicators**:
  - 🟢 Green bar = 100% complete (all 4 documents uploaded)
  - 🟡 Yellow bar = 50-99% complete (some documents missing)
  - 🔴 Red bar = 0-49% complete (most documents missing)
- **Completion details**:
  - Shows fraction: "3/4" (3 out of 4 documents uploaded)
  - Shows percentage: "75%"
  - Shows summary text: "Missing: Customer Inv"

#### Where It Appears:

### 2. **Smart Filters - Quick Action Buttons**

#### What Was Added:
8 smart filter buttons for instant filtering:

1. **All Batches** - Show everything (default)
2. **✓ Complete Batches** - Only batches with all 4 documents uploaded (100%)
3. **⚠ Incomplete Batches** - Only batches missing at least one document
4. **Missing PO** - Show only batches without Purchase Order
5. **Missing SO** - Show only batches without Sales Order
6. **Missing Supplier Invoice** - Show only batches without Supplier Invoice
7. **Missing Customer Invoice** - Show only batches without Customer Invoice

#### Where They Appear:
- Top of the filter section (before search and date filters)
- Color-coded buttons:
  - Green = Complete
  - Orange = Incomplete
  - Red = Missing specific documents
  - Gray = All batches

#### How It Works:
- Click any button to instantly filter the table
- Filters combine with existing search and date filters
- Works with local storage mode (currently)

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Required Documents:
Each batch requires **4 documents**:
1. Purchase Order (PO)
2. Sales Order (SO)
3. Supplier Invoice
4. Customer Invoice

### Completion Calculation:
```typescript
Percentage = (Uploaded Documents / Total Required) * 100
Complete = All 4 documents uploaded
Incomplete = At least 1 document missing
```

### Color Coding:
- **0-49%**: Red (critical - most docs missing)
- **50-99%**: Yellow (caution - some docs missing)
- **100%**: Green (success - all docs uploaded)

## 🔄 Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Customizable required documents per batch
- Export filtered results to CSV
- Batch completion history/trends over time
- Email alerts for incomplete batches
