# CRITICAL FIX: Batch-Scoped Relationship Detection

## Issue Identified
**Problem:** Same PO or SO numbers can appear in different batches, causing incorrect file grouping across batches.

**Example Scenario:**
```
Batch 6890:
- PO-1544_Page1.pdf
- PO-1544_Page2.pdf

Batch 6891:
- PO-1544_Contract.pdf  (DIFFERENT batch, SAME PO number)
- PO-1544_Invoice.pdf
```

**Old Behavior (INCORRECT):** ‚ùå
All 4 files would be grouped together as "Same PO" relationship, even though they belong to different batches.

**New Behavior (CORRECT):** ‚úÖ
- Batch 6890: Groups 2 files (Page1, Page2)
- Batch 6891: Groups 2 files separately (Contract, Invoice)

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `FileRelationship` Interface
Added `batchNumber` field to track which batch each relationship belongs to:

```typescript
export interface FileRelationship {
  groupId: string;
  relationshipType: 'same-po' | 'same-so' | 'sequence' | 'po-invoice-set' | 'so-invoice-set';
  batchNumber?: string; // NEW: Scopes relationship to specific batch
  files: Array<{ ... }>;
  confidence: number;
  completeness: { ... };
  suggestion: string;
  warnings?: string[];
}
```

### 2. Enhanced `detectFileRelationships()` Function
Now accepts optional `fileToBatchMap` parameter:

```typescript
export function detectFileRelationships(
  files: File[],
  extractedReferences?: Map<File, { po?: string[]; so?: string[]; batch?: string[] }>,
  fileToBatchMap?: Map<File, string> // NEW: Maps files to batch numbers
): RelationshipAnalysis
```

**New Logic:**
1. If `fileToBatchMap` is provided, group files by batch FIRST
2. Process each batch independently for relationships
3. Generate batch-scoped group IDs: `same-po-6890-1544` instead of `same-po-1544`

### 3. Updated Helper Functions
All helper functions now accept optional `batchNumber` parameter:

- `createRelationshipGroup(..., batchNumber?: string)`
- `detectSequences(..., batchNumber?: string)`
- `detectPoInvoiceSets(..., batchNumber?: string)`

### 4. Updated UI Integration
`BulkUploadModal.tsx` now creates and passes batch mapping:

```typescript
// Create file-to-batch mapping from upload plan
const fileToBatchMap = new Map<File, string>();
for (const analysis of plan.analyses) {
  if (analysis.matchedBatch) {
    fileToBatchMap.set(analysis.file, String(analysis.matchedBatch));
  }
}

// Pass to relationship detection
const relationships = detectFileRelationships(
  selectedFiles,
  undefined,
  fileToBatchMap // Batch-aware detection enabled
);
```

---

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ Prevents Cross-Batch Grouping
Files from different batches are never grouped together, even with identical PO/SO numbers.

### ‚úÖ Accurate Relationships
Each batch maintains its own relationship groups independently.

### ‚úÖ Clear Identification
Group IDs and suggestions now include batch numbers for clarity:
- Old: "3 files belong to PO-1544"
- New: "3 files belong to PO-1544 (Batch 6890)"

### ‚úÖ Backward Compatible
Function still works without batch mapping (logs warning):
```
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Batch-aware detection not enabled. 
Same PO/SO across different batches may be incorrectly grouped!
```

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified:
1. ‚úÖ `utils/relationshipDetector.ts` (200+ lines changed)
   - Added `batchNumber` field to interface
   - Updated main detection function
   - Updated all helper functions
   - Added batch-scoped processing logic

2. ‚úÖ `components/BulkUploadModal.tsx` (10 lines changed)
   - Create file-to-batch mapping
   - Pass mapping to relationship detector

### Files Unchanged:
- UI components (already display batch info through suggestion text)
- Visual similarity detector (not affected)
- Other modules

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Same PO, Different Batches
```typescript
Input:
Batch 6890:
  - PO-1544_Doc1.pdf
  - PO-1544_Doc2.pdf

Batch 6891:
  - PO-1544_Doc3.pdf
  - PO-1544_Doc4.pdf

Expected Result:
‚úì 2 separate relationship groups
  Group 1: Batch 6890, 2 files
  Group 2: Batch 6891, 2 files

Old (Incorrect) Result:
‚úó 1 relationship group with all 4 files
```

### Test Case 2: Same SO, Different Batches
```typescript
Input:
Batch 6890:
  - JLOV1293-11_Page1.pdf
  - JLOV1293-11_Page2.pdf

Batch 6892:
  - JLOV1293-11_Invoice.pdf

Expected Result:
‚úì 2 separate relationship groups
  Group 1: Batch 6890, 2 files (sequence)
  Group 2: Batch 6892, 1 file (orphaned or different group)

Old (Incorrect) Result:
‚úó 1 relationship group with all 3 files
```

### Test Case 3: Sequences Within Same Batch
```typescript
Input:
Batch 6890:
  - Contract Page 1 of 3.pdf
  - Contract Page 2 of 3.pdf
  - Contract Page 3 of 3.pdf

Expected Result:
‚úì 1 relationship group (complete sequence, Batch 6890)

Result: CORRECT (no change from before)
```

---

## UI Display Changes

### Relationship Panel
Group suggestions now show batch number:

**Before:**
```
üîó Same Purchase Order
3 files belong to PO-1544
```

**After:**
```
üîó Same Purchase Order
3 files belong to PO-1544 (Batch 6890)
```

### Console Logging
New debug messages:
```
üì¶ Batch-aware relationship detection enabled
  Processing batch 6890 with 5 files
  Processing batch 6891 with 3 files
‚úÖ Found 3 relationship groups (2 complete, 1 incomplete)
```

---

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Overhead
- Batch grouping: O(n) where n = number of files
- Processing per batch: Same as before
- Overall: No significant performance change

### Memory Impact
- Additional Map storage: ~100 bytes per file
- Negligible for typical batch sizes (10-100 files)

---

## Migration Notes

### Existing Code
All existing calls to `detectFileRelationships()` continue to work:
```typescript
// Old (still works, but logs warning)
const relationships = detectFileRelationships(files);

// New (recommended)
const relationships = detectFileRelationships(files, undefined, fileToBatchMap);
```

### Recommended Action
Update all calls to pass batch mapping when available for accurate results.

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### Case 1: Files Without Batch Assignment
Files not in the batch map are processed separately in the fallback logic.

### Case 2: Mixed Batch Assignments
Some files have batch, others don't - both are handled correctly.

### Case 3: Empty Batch Map
Function falls back to original behavior with warning.

### Case 4: Multiple Batches with Same PO
Each batch creates its own group with unique IDs:
- `same-po-6890-1544`
- `same-po-6891-1544`
- `same-po-6892-1544`
