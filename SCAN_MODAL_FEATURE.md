# Scan Modal Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The scan functionality has been moved from the cramped SettingsPanel sidebar (320px) to a full-screen modal that provides comprehensive duplicate management capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Full-Screen Scan Modal (`components/ScanModal.tsx`)
- **Layout**: Large modal (max-w-6xl ≈ 1152px) with header, scrollable content, and footer
- **Real-time Progress Display**: 
  - Animated progress bar showing percentage completion
  - Three statistics cards: Files Found, New Entries, Backup Created
  - Folder-by-folder progress updates with file counts
  
### 2. Duplicate Detection & Management
- **Batch-Scoped Detection**: Duplicates are only detected **within the same batch folder**
  - This is crucial because the same PO can legitimately appear in multiple batch folders for different products
  - Each batch is processed independently to avoid false positives across batches
  
- **Three Detection Methods** (from `localStorageService.ts`):
  1. **Hash Match (100% confidence)**: Exact file content match using SHA-256
  2. **Name + Size Match (90% confidence)**: Same filename and file size
  3. **Similar Names (70% confidence)**: Names differ only by version numbers

- **Duplicate Display**:
  - Organized into expandable groups by match type
  - Color-coded files: 
    - Green badge = Newest file (recommended to keep)
    - Red highlighting = Selected for deletion
  - Detailed metadata for each file:
    - Batch number and document type
    - File size and last modified date
    - Content hash (for 100% matches)
    - Full file path

### 3. Bulk Duplicate Management
- **Checkbox Selection**: 
  - Individual file selection across all groups
  - Visual feedback with red highlighting
  
- **Smart Selection**:
  - "Select Oldest" button per group
  - Automatically keeps the newest file
  - Selects all older versions for deletion
  
- **Deletion**:
  - Bulk delete selected files button
  - Confirmation dialog before deletion
  - Removes files from both filesystem and upload history
  - Auto-refreshes scan results after deletion

### 4. Folder Management
- **Open Folder Button**: 
  - Available for each file
  - Opens file location in system file explorer
  - Uses Electron API (desktop app) or displays path (web)

### 5. Statistics Dashboard
Four summary cards displaying:
- **Files Found**: Total files discovered during scan
- **New Entries**: Files added to upload history
- **Entries Preserved**: Existing history entries kept
- **Backup Created**: Confirmation of history backup

## Technical Implementation

### State Management (App.tsx)
```typescript
// Scan modal states
const [showScanModal, setShowScanModal] = useState<boolean>(false);
const [isScanning, setIsScanning] = useState<boolean>(false);
const [scanProgress, setScanProgress] = useState<ScanProgress | null>(null);
const [scanResult, setScanResult] = useState<ScanResult | null>(null);
```

### Handler Functions

#### 1. Scan Trigger
```typescript
const handleScanAndRebuild = async () => {
  // Opens modal, initializes scan
  // Updates progress in real-time via callback
  // Displays results with duplicate detection
}
```

#### 2. File Deletion
```typescript
const handleDeleteDuplicateFiles = async (filesToDelete) => {
  // Deletes selected files from filesystem
  // Updates upload history
  // Re-runs scan to refresh results
}
```

#### 3. Folder Opening
```typescript
const handleOpenFolder = async (batchNumber, docType) => {
  // Uses Electron API (desktop) or shows path alert (web)
  // Opens folder in system file explorer
}
```

### User Interface Access

#### Main Window Trigger
- **"Scan Files" button** added to Header toolbar
- Prominent blue button with search icon
- Visible in main window (not hidden in sidebar)
- Located next to Refresh and Settings buttons

#### Modal Controls
- **Close button**: Top-right corner
- **Expand/Collapse**: Toggle visibility of duplicate groups
- **Select Oldest**: Smart selection within each group
- **Delete Selected**: Bulk deletion with confirmation
- **Open Folder**: Individual file location access

## Data Flow

1. **User clicks "Scan Files"** in Header
2. **Modal opens** → `showScanModal = true`
3. **Scan starts** → `isScanning = true`
4. **Progress updates** → Real-time via `setScanProgress()`
5. **Scan completes** → Results displayed with duplicate groups
6. **User manages duplicates**:
   - Selects files manually or uses "Select Oldest"
   - Clicks "Delete Selected Files"
   - Confirms deletion
7. **Files deleted** → Scan auto-refreshes with updated results
8. **User reviews** or closes modal

## Key Files Modified

### Created
- `components/ScanModal.tsx` (659 lines)

### Modified
- `App.tsx`: Added state, handlers, modal component, scan trigger
- `components/Header.tsx`: Added "Scan Files" button
- `services/localStorageService.ts`: Already had duplicate detection (previous session)

## Integration Points

### Props Interface (ScanModal)
```typescript
interface ScanModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  isScanning: boolean;
  scanProgress: ScanProgress | null;
  scanResult: ScanResult | null;
  onClose: () => void;
  onDeleteFiles: (files: Array<{
    batchNumber: string;
    docType: string;
    fileName: string;
  }>) => Promise<void>;
  onOpenFolder: (batchNumber: string, docType: string) => Promise<void>;
}
```

### Type Definitions
```typescript
// From localStorageService.ts
export interface ScanProgress {
  currentFolder: string;
  currentBatch: string;
  currentDocType: string;
  filesFound: number;
  newEntries: number;
  totalFolders: number;
  processedFolders: number;
}

export interface DuplicateGroup {
  files: DuplicateFileInfo[];
  reason: string;
  matchConfidence: number;
}

export interface ScanResult {
  totalFiles: number;
  newEntries: number;
  preservedEntries: number;
  backupCreated: boolean;
  duplicateGroups: DuplicateGroup[];
  totalDuplicates: number;
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before (SettingsPanel)
- Limited space (320px sidebar)
- Cramped duplicate display
- Difficult to compare multiple files
- No bulk selection
- Hidden in settings menu

### After (ScanModal)
- Full-screen view (1152px)
- Expandable groups with rich metadata
- Side-by-side file comparison
- Checkbox selection with smart defaults
- Accessible from main toolbar
- Clear visual indicators (colors, badges)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Click "Scan Files" button opens modal
- [ ] Progress bar updates during scan
- [ ] Statistics display correctly
- [ ] Duplicate groups are expandable
- [ ] File metadata is accurate
- [ ] Checkboxes select/deselect files
- [ ] "Select Oldest" keeps newest file
- [ ] Delete confirmation dialog appears
- [ ] Files are removed from filesystem
- [ ] Upload history is updated after deletion
- [ ] Scan auto-refreshes after deletion
- [ ] "Open Folder" works (Electron/Web)
- [ ] Modal closes properly
- [ ] Large datasets (100+ files) perform well

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Filter duplicates** by confidence level or file type
2. **Preview files** before deletion (thumbnail/content)
3. **Undo deletion** with restore from backup
4. **Export duplicate report** to CSV/JSON
5. **Schedule automatic scans** (e.g., daily)
6. **Show duplicate trends** over time
7. **Custom duplicate rules** (e.g., ignore certain patterns)
8. **Merge duplicates** instead of just deleting

## Notes

- The scan functionality remains accessible via SettingsPanel for convenience
- Deletion is permanent (files are removed from filesystem)
- Upload history backup is created before each scan
- **Duplicate detection is batch-scoped**: Only compares files within the same batch folder, not across batches
- This prevents false positives when the same PO appears in multiple batches for different products
- All three detection methods run simultaneously within each batch
- Newest file is determined by "last modified" timestamp
